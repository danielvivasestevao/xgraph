# Redundancy and Coexistence tools

This Python project contains classes and functions to generate graphs and to
test them for redundancy and coexistence properties.
<br>
The core of the project is the Graphs/Xgraph.py file.
<br>
**Features:**
- generate graphs according to Poisson Point Processes
- create and save graph plots (with multicore support)
- cluster graphs
- test graphs for redundancy and coexistence properties (with multicore support)
- plot graphs interactively and inspect redundancy/coexistence events in a GUI
